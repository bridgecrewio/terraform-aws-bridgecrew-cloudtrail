## Installation Options

This is a terraform module that creates an Amazon Web Services (AWS) CloudTrail integration with Bridgecrew.

### Starting fresh

This stack is created with all the best practices and CIS benchmark requirements:

1. A dedicated CMK is created, with rotation enabled.
2. A CloudTrail trail is created, and it's logs are encrypted-at-rest using the dedicated CMK.
3. The logs bucket has Versioning enabled and denies unsecure (non-HTTPS) connections.

### Connecting to an existing CloudTrail trail

The module supports connecting to an existing CloudTrail trail. This requires 3 inputs:

1. Setting `create_cloudtrail` to false.
2. Supplying the name of the bucket where the CloudTrail logs are being saved to, as `existing_bucket_name`.
3. Supplying the ARN of the SNS used by the trail to notify of new logs, in `existing_sns_arn`.
This can be configured manually on the existing trail.
4. If a KMS key is associated with this CloudTrail, update the key policy to allow Bridgecrew to decrypt.  For example:

```json
        {
          "Sid" : "Enable Bridgecrew log decryption",
          "Effect": "Allow",
          "Principal": {
            "AWS" : "arn:aws:iam::${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:role/${var.company_name}-bc-bridgecrewcwssarole"
          },
          "Action": [ "kms:Decrypt", "kms:ReEncryptFrom" ],
          "Resource": "*",
          "Condition": {
            "StringEquals" : {
              "kms:CallerAccount" : "${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}" },
              "StringLike": {
                "kms:EncryptionContext:aws:cloudtrail:arn" : "arn:aws:cloudtrail:*:${data.aws_caller_identity.current.account_id}:trail/*"
              }
            }
        },
```

### Creating a CloudTrail trail and other infrastructure in seperate AWS accounts

This module supports creating a CloudTrail trail in one account, and creating the rest of the infrastructure in a seperate account.
This may be optimal in cases where you want an organization trail from the organization master, but you want it to send logs to a bucket in a logs account.

#### In the bucket destination account

1. Set `create_cloudtrail` to false.
2. Set `source_account_id` to the account that will host the cloudtrail

#### In the trail source account

1. Set `existing_bucket_name`, `existing_kms_key_arn`, and `existing_sns_arn` to values output in the previous step
2. Set `create_bridgecrew_connection` to false

In both accounts, be sure to set the `organization_id` if this is an organization-wide trail.

## Usage

Include **module.cloudtrail.tf** in your existing Terraform code, and/or see *example/examplea* as your guide:

```terraform
module "cloudtrail" {
  source      = "bridgecrewio/bridgecrew-cloudtrail/aws"
  version     = "v1.5.4"
  org_name    = "<your org name>"
  aws_profile = "<aws profile>"
  api-token   = var.api_token
}
```
